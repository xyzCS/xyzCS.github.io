Hi, I'm a second-year PhD student at the [NLP group](https://kclnlp.github.io/) at King's College London, advised by [Prof. Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe) and [Dr. Lin Gui](https://sites.google.com/view/lin-gui/about-me). My research interests lies in AI for Scientific Discovery, AI for Software Engineering and AI Agent.

Before KCL, I finished my M.S. at Southeast University(09.2020-07.2023) and my B.E. at Hefei University of Technology(09.2016-07.2020).
